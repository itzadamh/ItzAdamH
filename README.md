# Getting to know me?
- 👀 I’m particularly interested in Software Development.
- 🏫 I'm currently a Second Year B.Sc Computer Science Student @ DCU. I am enjoying learning new languages and getting hands-on experience.
  -  I have already obtained a QQI Level 5 Certificate in Software Development from the Drogheda Institute of Further Education (DIFE).
- 🔭 The language I am most familiar with is Python.
- 💻 I have played around with HTML, CSS, Javascript & Kotlin, and more recently C.
- 📝 I still consider myself a beginner in all of the languages I have mentioned. I am eager to further develop my skills in these languages.
